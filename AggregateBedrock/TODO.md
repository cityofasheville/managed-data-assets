1. Move information about where an asset is from ETL to the location (e.g., DB + schema + tablename or GoogleSheets + sheet ID + tab_name + range) - JTW
2. Kill the NOOP hack in ETL for assets that have no ETL tasks - EJ
3. Create an Aggregate type - TBD
4. Implement table copy with an Aggregate type as a source - TBD
5. (Maybe) add dynamic asset names, maybe just tag-based ones.
I will add 1-4 to Asana. I also need to add a task to add tags to assets - they aren't there yet.
